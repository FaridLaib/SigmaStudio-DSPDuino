# SigmaStudio-DSPDuino

This program enables an Arduino or ESP32 to communicate with an Analog Devices ADAU1701 SigmaDSP over the I¬≤C (Wire) interface.
It allows real-time volume adjustment through serial commands.


‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Initialization
Sets up I¬≤C communication using the Wire library.
Initializes the SigmaDSP using the SigmaDSP library.
Loads a precompiled DSP program (SigmaDSP_parameters.h).
Sets the initial volume to 0 dB.
Runtime Control
Continuously listens for serial input.
When receiving a command like:
Volume: -10
it updates the DSP‚Äôs software volume control block (MOD_SWVOL1_ALG0_TARGET_ADDR) accordingly.
Feedback
Prints confirmation messages to the Serial Monitor for debugging and verification.


üßæ Key Components
MCUdude is a fantastic library to understand the parameters and values.

SigmaDSP.h ‚Äî Handles communication and control of the ADAU1701.
SigmaDSP_parameters.h ‚Äî Contains the DSP program binary and address definitions exported from SigmaStudio.
Wire (I¬≤C) ‚Äî Interface used for data transfer between the microcontroller and DSP.
